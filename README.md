# TopCoder
Solutions to problems in the [TopCoder archives](http://community.topcoder.com/tc?&sc=12&sd=asc&module=MatchList&nr=50) using the standard library.

Each solution is self contained in single file. To build using the following command from a Developer Command Prompt
```
cl solution.cpp
```
